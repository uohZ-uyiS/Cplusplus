main(){
	read one line from input File, store the data into lineString
	p pointer to the first char of lineString // p will pointer to different char later

	while( *p != the end of file){
		parse the p by Query(), if p point to the end of the current lineString, then p will be pointer the the start of next line, Pointer() works for this
		after Query(), p will pointer to to the next new char which haven't been parsed in JQuery()
	}
}

JQuery(){
	when *p is '{'
		move to next char, push '.' into the vector of path, detect whether this is start char of Key, if yes, get the key and push key into the vectot of path, move to the next char
	when *p is '['
		move to the next char
		push '[]' into the vector of path,update the index of [] later
	when *p is ':'
		move to the next char
		if current char is the start of value, get the value, move the pointer to the end of the value
			-- if the value is "key":"test, test", "key":true
			-- if the value is "key":[[2,3],[4,6]],"key":["ac","ab"]
			-- if the value is "key":[]
			-- if the value id "key":{ }
		push ':' into the vector of path, till now, got the full path and value
		call the matchQuery() to check whether this path satifies the query
		call checkparent() to see whether this key-value is the last element for the upper level, if yes, modify the vector of path
	when *p is ','
		move to next char, detect whether this is start char of Key, if yes,do the operation 
	when *p is other char
		move to next char, detect whether this is start char of Key, if yes,do the operation 

	return
}

matchQuery(){
	update the index of [] in the path
	pop the Key and ':' in the vector of the path, so the remaining vector could be used for next path, if the next path is at the same level of the current one
	if current path is satisfied the query, the key value will print out
}
